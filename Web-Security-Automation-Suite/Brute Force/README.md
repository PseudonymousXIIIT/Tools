# üîì Web Login Brute-Force Script

This Python script performs a **brute-force attack** on a web application's login form. It tries a list of passwords against a specified username and checks for login success based on a known failure message.

---

## üß† How It Works

- Accepts:
  - Target URL
  - Username
  - Password list (wordlist)
  - Login failure string (used to detect failed login)
  - Optional session cookie
- Tries each password in the wordlist.
- If login fails (failure string is present), it tries the next password.
- If login succeeds (failure string not found), it reports the valid credentials.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `requests` library  
- `termcolor` for colored console output

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests termcolor
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python3 bruteforce.py
```

You will be prompted to input:
- Target login **URL**
- Target **username**
- Path to your **password list** (e.g., `rockyou.txt`)
- The **login failure string** (e.g., `"Invalid credentials"`)
- Optional cookie value for session-authenticated attempts

---

## üìÑ Code Overview

- Uses `POST` (or `GET` if cookie is set) to try credentials.
- Checks response for a failure string.
- Terminates if a match is found.

## üß™ Example

```
[+] Enter Page URL: https://example.com/login
[+] Enter Username For The Account To Bruteforce: admin
[+] Enter Password File To Use: passwords.txt
[+] Enter String That Occurs When Login Fails: Invalid
Enter Cookie Value(Optional):
```

Output:
```
Trying: 123456
Trying: password1
[+] Found Username: ==> admin
[+] Found Password: ==> secret123
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages (see requirements.txt):
  - requests==2.31.0
  - termcolor==2.3.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Navigate to the tool directory:
